Here's an example `package.json` file to match the website project you described:

```
{
  "name": "my-website",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript",
  "main": "index.html",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "serve",
    "build": "echo This is a static website, there is no bundler or bundling involved!"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/your-username/my-website.git"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "HTML",
    "CSS",
    "JavaScript",
    "website",
    "static"
  ],
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/your-username/my-website/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/your-username/my-website#readme",
  "devDependencies": {
    "serve": "^11.2.0"
  }
}
```

You may need to modify some of the values such as the `name`, `description`, `repository`, `author`, and `bugs` values to match your project details.
